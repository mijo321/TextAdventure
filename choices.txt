You decide to visit one of the suspects and see what they have to say. You can choose between Jens, Daniil, or Hightower. Each one has a different personality and a different story.
You: Alright, time to get to work. I need to talk to the suspects and see if they have any clues or alibis. Who should I visit first?
Jens, the IT teacher. He might be jealous of Sondre’s success or popularity. He also plays chess with him. Maybe he lost one too many games and snapped.
Daniil, the student. He likes to break the rules of the båsene and might have a grudge against Sondre for disciplining him. He also eats a lot of protein bars. Maybe he has some anger issues.
Hightower, the mental health teacher. He is intimidating and scary, but has no clear motive. He also counsels students and staff. Maybe he knows something I don’t.
